# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the build issues in the Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project to enable full verification of the documented architectural work. The project has excellent architecture and documentation but suffers from TypeScript configuration issues, missing dependencies, and component implementation problems that prevent successful compilation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to build successfully without TypeScript errors, so that I can deploy and verify the documented performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN all components SHALL have proper type definitions
3. WHEN building for production THEN all pages SHALL generate successfully without prerender errors
4. WHEN importing components THEN all module dependencies SHALL resolve correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all motion/animation components to work properly, so that the user experience matches the documented design specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Framer Motion components THEN they SHALL have correct TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN motion components are rendered THEN they SHALL not cause build failures
3. WHEN animations are triggered THEN they SHALL execute without runtime errors
4. WHEN replacing motion components THEN fallback implementations SHALL maintain visual consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing dependencies and imports to be resolved, so that the application runs without module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing from '@/lib/components/CleanComponentPatterns' THEN the module SHALL exist and export required interfaces
2. WHEN importing from '@/lib/logging/LoggingIntegration' THEN the logging service SHALL be available
3. WHEN using component interfaces THEN all required types SHALL be properly defined
4. WHEN building the application THEN no "module not found" errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the performance optimizations to be verifiable, so that I can validate the documented 82% re-render reduction and other performance claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds successfully THEN performance testing SHALL be possible
2. WHEN context providers are used THEN re-render optimization SHALL be measurable
3. WHEN caching is implemented THEN cache hit rates SHALL be trackable
4. WHEN running Lighthouse tests THEN scores SHALL be verifiable against documented claims

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and fallbacks, so that the application remains stable even when individual components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component fails to load THEN error boundaries SHALL prevent application crashes
2. WHEN TypeScript errors occur THEN clear error messages SHALL guide resolution
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN graceful fallbacks SHALL be provided
4. WHEN building fails THEN specific error locations SHALL be identified
