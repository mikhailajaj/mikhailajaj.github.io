# Documentation Migration Report

This report documents the files that were read from the `docs` directory and migrated to the `rules` directory as part of the documentation restructuring effort. It also provides a plan for completing the documentation in directories that are currently empty or have minimal content.

## Overview

The goal was to create a comprehensive set of guidelines in the `rules` directory based on existing documentation in the `docs` directory. This involved reading various documentation files, extracting relevant information, and creating new structured guideline documents.

While significant progress has been made in creating guidelines for React hooks, React design patterns, software engineering principles, and task management, many directories in the `rules` directory are still empty or have minimal content. This report outlines what has been accomplished so far and provides a detailed plan for filling the remaining directories.

## Updated Files

- `/docs/rules/SUMMARY.md` - Updated to include references to all the new documents
  - Added sections for React documentation, hooks documentation, software engineering documentation, and task management documentation
  - Organized the documentation into clear sections for easy navigation

## Approach

The documentation was created following these principles:

1. **Modular Approach**: Each topic has its own dedicated file, making it easier to find specific guidelines
2. **Reference-Based**: Files reference each other rather than duplicating content
3. **Structured Organization**: The main README and SUMMARY files serve as indexes to help navigate the documentation
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each document provides detailed guidelines with examples and best practices
5. **Consistent Format**: All documents follow a consistent format with clear headings, examples, and references

## Directory Status

The following directories have been created and populated with content:

- `/docs/rules/hooks/` - Comprehensive hook guidelines

## Conclusion

The documentation migration has resulted in a comprehensive set of guidelines in the `rules` directory that covers React development, hooks, software engineering principles, and task management. However, many directories are still empty or have minimal content. The plan outlined above provides a roadmap for filling these directories with comprehensive guidelines.

The modular approach makes it easy for developers to find the specific guidelines they need, while the structured organization ensures that the documentation is maintainable and extensible.

Next steps:
1. Implement the plan for filling empty directories
2. Review existing documentation for completeness and accuracy
3. Add more examples and code snippets to existing documents
4. Create interactive examples or diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
5. Set up a process for regularly reviewing and updating the guidelines
