# Portfolio Rules Implementation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive quality improvements to the Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio based on the established rules and guidelines. The implementation focuses on accessibility compliance, domain-aware architecture, performance optimization, and professional standards that showcase technical expertise across five domains: Full-Stack Development, Cloud Engineering, Data Analytics, UX/UI Design, and Technical Consulting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want the portfolio to be fully accessible so that I can navigate, understand, and interact with all content using assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable via Tab key
2. WHEN a user focuses on an element THEN the focus indicator SHALL be clearly visible with 2px outline
3. WHEN a user uses a screen reader THEN all content SHALL be properly announced with appropriate ARIA labels
4. WHEN a user views text content THEN color contrast SHALL meet 4.5:1 minimum ratio for normal text
5. WHEN a user views large text THEN color contrast SHALL meet 3:1 minimum ratio
6. WHEN a user interacts on mobile THEN touch targets SHALL be minimum 44px x 44px
7. WHEN a user has reduced motion preferences THEN animations SHALL be disabled or reduced

### Requirement 2: Domain-Aware Architecture Implementation

**User Story:** As a potential client or employer, I want to see clear organization by expertise domains so that I can easily understand the breadth of technical capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads THEN domain colors SHALL be applied consistently across components
2. WHEN a user navigates between domains THEN theming SHALL update to reflect the current domain
3. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL use domain-specific styling where appropriate
4. WHEN navigation is displayed THEN domain colors SHALL be used for visual hierarchy
5. WHEN projects are shown THEN they SHALL be categorized by domain with appropriate theming

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user visiting the portfolio, I want fast loading times and smooth interactions so that I have a positive experience that reflects the developer's technical competency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN Largest Contentful Paint SHALL be under 1.2 seconds
2. WHEN a user interacts with elements THEN First Input Delay SHALL be under 100ms
3. WHEN content loads THEN Cumulative Layout Shift SHALL be under 0.1
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN Core Web Vitals SHALL be monitored and tracked
5. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL be optimized with WebP format and lazy loading
6. WHEN components render THEN heavy components SHALL be code-split and lazy-loaded

### Requirement 4: Component Enhancement and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all components to follow consistent patterns and be thoroughly tested so that the code remains maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow the established component structure
2. WHEN components are tested THEN they SHALL include unit, accessibility, and interaction tests
3. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL include proper TypeScript types and JSDoc documentation
4. WHEN components are used THEN they SHALL provide clear error handling and loading states
5. WHEN components are styled THEN they SHALL use the design system tokens and utilities

### Requirement 5: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the portfolio to work perfectly on my device so that I can explore the content comfortably regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN all content SHALL be accessible and readable
2. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN they SHALL be smooth and responsive
3. WHEN the viewport changes THEN layout SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN navigation is used on mobile THEN it SHALL be touch-friendly and accessible
5. WHEN performance is measured on mobile THEN Lighthouse score SHALL be 90+

### Requirement 6: Development Workflow and Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a developer working on the portfolio, I want automated quality checks and clear guidelines so that I can maintain high standards consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN automated checks SHALL validate accessibility, performance, and code quality
2. WHEN components are developed THEN they SHALL follow the import hierarchy and structure guidelines
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL include accessibility testing with axe
4. WHEN builds occur THEN performance budgets SHALL be enforced
5. WHEN code is reviewed THEN it SHALL meet all established quality standards
