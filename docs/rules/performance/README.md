# Performance Guidelines

Web performance is critical for user experience, engagement, and SEO. This section provides guidelines and best practices for optimizing the performance of the **Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio** application, focusing on professional presentation, fast loading times, and smooth interactions that reflect technical expertise.

## Core Principles

-   **Measure First**: Use performance monitoring tools (Lighthouse, WebPageTest, Next.js Analytics, browser DevTools) to identify bottlenecks before attempting optimizations.
-   **Prioritize User Experience**: Focus on metrics that directly impact the user's perception of speed, such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
-   **Minimize Client-Side Work**: Offload work to the server whenever possible (using Server Components, Server Actions). Reduce the amount of JavaScript shipped to the client.
-   **Load Only What's Needed**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading for components, libraries, and assets.
-   **Optimize Assets**: Compress images, use modern formats, and optimize fonts.
-   **Leverage Caching**: Utilize browser and server-side caching effectively.

## Key Areas

This section covers the following key areas of web performance optimization:

-   **[Rendering Optimization](./rendering-optimization.md)**: Techniques for optimizing React component rendering.
-   **[Code Splitting](./code-splitting.md)**: Strategies for splitting code into smaller chunks loaded on demand.
-   **[Bundle Size](./bundle-size.md)**: Methods for analyzing and reducing the size of JavaScript bundles.
-   **[Caching](./caching.md)**: Leveraging Next.js data caching and HTTP caching.
-   **[Image Optimization](./image-optimization.md)**: Best practices for handling images efficiently.

Refer to the specific documents linked above for detailed rules and implementation guidance. Many Next.js features (Server Components, automatic code splitting, image optimization) contribute significantly to performance when used correctly.
