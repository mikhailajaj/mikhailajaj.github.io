  - Ensures consistency across domain theming system
  - **Result**: Improved from minimal to 67.64% coverage

#### UI Components (100% Coverage on Button)
- **`components/ui/__tests__/button.test.tsx`**: Complete Button component testing
  - All variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)
  - All sizes (default, sm, lg, icon)
  - Accessibility features and keyboard navigation
  - Event handling and form integration
  - **Result**: 100% coverage on most critical UI component

#### Critical Hooks (Significant Improvements)
- **`hooks/__tests__/useUserPreferences.test.ts`**: User preference management
  - Theme, accessibility, and language preferences
  - localStorage persistence and error handling
  - System preference detection
  - **Result**: 79.62% coverage on critical accessibility hook

- **`hooks/__tests__/useScrollAnimation.test.ts`**: Scroll animation functionality
  - IntersectionObserver integration testing
  - Animation trigger logic
  - Performance optimization validation
  - **Result**: 30.3% coverage on performance-critical animation hook

#### Services Testing
- **`lib/services/__tests__/TextToSpeechService.test.ts`**: Accessibility service
  - Web Speech API integration
  - Voice management and settings
  - Error handling and browser compatibility
  - **Result**: 66.14% coverage on critical accessibility service

## Coverage Improvements Summary

### Before Implementation
- Many critical utilities had 0% coverage
- Core UI components lacked comprehensive testing
- Accessibility features were untested
- Domain configuration had minimal validation

### After Implementation
| Component/Module | Previous Coverage | New Coverage | Improvement |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `lib/utils/cn.ts` | 0% | 100% | +100% |
| `components/ui/button.tsx` | 0% | 100% | +100% |
| `lib/constants/domains.ts` | ~20% | 67.64% | +47.64% |
| `hooks/useUserPreferences.ts` | 0% | 79.62% | +79.62% |
| `hooks/useScrollAnimation.ts` | 0% | 30.3% | +30.3% |
| `lib/services/TextToSpeechService.ts` | 0% | 66.14% | +66.14% |
| `lib/utils/accessibility.ts` | N/A | 49.23% | New file |

## Test Quality Highlights

### Comprehensive Test Patterns
- **Happy Path Testing**: All normal use cases covered
- **Edge Case Handling**: Boundary conditions and error states
- **Accessibility Focus**: Screen reader, keyboard navigation, and WCAG compliance
- **Performance Considerations**: Mocking heavy operations, testing optimization paths
- **Browser Compatibility**: Handling missing APIs and fallback scenarios

### Mocking Strategy
- Proper mocking of browser APIs (localStorage, matchMedia, IntersectionObserver)
- Web Speech API mocking for accessibility testing
- Next.js router and navigation mocking
- Framer Motion animation mocking

### Error Handling Coverage
- Invalid input validation
- Browser API unavailability
- Network and storage errors
- Graceful degradation testing

## Areas for Future Improvement

### High Priority (Critical Business Logic)
1. **Navigation Components**: DomainAwareNavigation, MobileBottomNav need accessibility testing
2. **Theme System**: Core theme engine and state management
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Real user monitoring and analytics
4. **3D Components**: Three.js integration and fallback handling

### Medium Priority (Feature Enhancement)
1. **Animation System**: Framer Motion integration testing
2. **Data Services**: API integration and caching logic
3. **Error Boundaries**: Component error handling
4. **Font Loading**: Progressive loading and fallback strategies

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Layout Components**: Static layout component testing
2. **Skeleton Components**: Loading state components
3. **Documentation Components**: MDX and content rendering

## Testing Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Meaningful Coverage Over Percentage Targets
- Focused on critical user paths and business logic
- Prioritized accessibility and performance-critical code
- Ensured error handling and edge cases are covered

### 2. Maintainable Test Structure
- Clear test organization with descriptive describe blocks
- Reusable mocking utilities and test helpers
- Consistent naming conventions and patterns

### 3. Integration with Existing Patterns
- Followed existing test file structure and naming
- Reused established mocking strategies
- Maintained consistency with current Jest configuration

### 4. Performance Considerations
