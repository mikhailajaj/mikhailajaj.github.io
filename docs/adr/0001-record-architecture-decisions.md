# 0001-record-architecture-decisions

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Architecture decisions are those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques of the project. We want to maintain a record of these decisions for future reference and to help new team members understand the reasoning behind current architectural choices.

**Decision:**
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions for this project. ADRs will be stored in the `docs/adr/` directory and follow the format proposed by Michael Nygard. Each ADR will be numbered sequentially and include the status, context, decision, and consequences.

**Consequences:**
- Architectural decisions will be documented and easily accessible
- New team members can understand the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Decision-making process becomes more transparent and thoughtful
- Historical context is preserved for future architectural evolution
- Requires discipline to maintain and update ADRs as decisions evolve
