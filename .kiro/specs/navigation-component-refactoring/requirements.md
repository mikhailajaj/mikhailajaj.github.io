# Navigation Component Refactoring Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the comprehensive `DomainAwareNavigation` component into smaller, more manageable, and reusable components. The current component is approximately 400+ lines and handles multiple concerns including logo display, main navigation, domain switching, mobile navigation, and theme integration. This refactoring will improve maintainability, testability, and reusability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Current Component Analysis

### Existing Structure
The `DomainAwareNavigation` component currently handles:
- **Logo and branding display** with domain indicator
- **Main navigation menu** with 7 navigation items
- **Domain switching dropdown** with 5 domain options
- **Mobile navigation menu** with hamburger toggle
- **Keyboard navigation** and accessibility features
- **Theme integration** with domain-aware styling
- **Scroll-based styling** changes
- **Hydration safety** for SSR compatibility

### Complexity Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: ~400 lines
- **State Variables**: 6 state variables (mounted, isOpen, scrolled, focusedIndex, dropdownOpen)
- **Event Handlers**: 5 major event handlers
- **Conditional Rendering**: Multiple complex conditional blocks
- **Accessibility Features**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Decomposition

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the navigation system, I want the navigation component broken down into smaller, focused components, so that each component has a single responsibility and is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN components are tested THEN each SHALL be testable in isolation
4. WHEN components are reused THEN they SHALL work independently in other contexts
5. IF a component needs modification THEN changes SHALL not affect other components
6. WHEN reviewing code THEN each component SHALL be under 100 lines of code

### Requirement 2: Logo and Branding Component

**User Story:** As a user viewing the navigation, I want to see consistent branding and logo display that adapts to the current domain, so that I can easily identify the site and current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logo component renders THEN it SHALL display the "MA" logo with gradient background
2. WHEN the domain changes THEN the domain indicator SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the logo SHALL remain visible and properly sized
4. WHEN the logo is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the home page
5. IF the domain indicator is present THEN it SHALL show the current domain name and color
6. WHEN using screen readers THEN the logo SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels

### Requirement 3: Main Navigation Component

**User Story:** As a user navigating the site, I want a clear and accessible main navigation menu that highlights the current page and provides smooth interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main navigation renders THEN it SHALL display all 7 navigation items
2. WHEN a navigation item is active THEN it SHALL be visually highlighted with domain colors
3. WHEN hovering over items THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN focus SHALL move logically between items
5. IF an item is clicked THEN navigation SHALL occur smoothly
6. WHEN using screen readers THEN current page SHALL be announced appropriately

### Requirement 4: Domain Switcher Component

**User Story:** As a user exploring different expertise areas, I want an intuitive domain switching interface that clearly shows available domains and allows easy switching between them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the domain switcher renders THEN it SHALL show "Expertise" with dropdown indicator
2. WHEN clicked THEN it SHALL open a dropdown with all 5 domains
3. WHEN a domain is selected THEN the current domain SHALL change immediately
4. WHEN the dropdown is open THEN keyboard navigation SHALL work properly
5. IF the dropdown is open THEN clicking outside SHALL close it
6. WHEN domains are displayed THEN each SHALL show icon, name, and description

### Requirement 5: Mobile Navigation Component

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a responsive navigation menu that provides full functionality in a mobile-optimized interface with proper touch targets and smooth animations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on mobile devices THEN a hamburger menu button SHALL be visible
2. WHEN the hamburger is tapped THEN the mobile menu SHALL slide open smoothly
3. WHEN the mobile menu is open THEN all navigation items SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN items are tapped THEN the menu SHALL close and navigate appropriately
5. IF the menu is open THEN the escape key SHALL close it
6. WHEN using the mobile menu THEN touch targets SHALL be appropriately sized (min 44px)

### Requirement 6: Theme Integration Component

**User Story:** As a user with theme preferences, I want the navigation to include theme switching capabilities that integrate seamlessly with the domain-aware theming system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme button is present THEN it SHALL toggle between light/dark modes
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN the navigation SHALL adapt its colors immediately
3. WHEN domains change THEN theme colors SHALL update to match the domain
4. WHEN the theme button is used THEN the preference SHALL persist across sessions
5. IF system theme changes THEN the navigation SHALL respect the system preference
6. WHEN using the theme button THEN it SHALL be accessible via keyboard and screen readers

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the navigation components to provide full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable
2. WHEN focus moves THEN visual focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all elements SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels
4. WHEN navigation state changes THEN screen readers SHALL announce the changes
5. IF keyboard shortcuts are used THEN they SHALL work consistently across components
6. WHEN testing with accessibility tools THEN all components SHALL pass WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Requirement 8: Performance and Hydration Safety

**User Story:** As a user accessing the site, I want fast navigation loading with no hydration mismatches or layout shifts, ensuring a smooth initial experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN navigation SHALL render without hydration mismatches
2. WHEN components mount THEN there SHALL be no layout shifts or flashing
3. WHEN navigation renders THEN performance SHALL be optimized with proper memoization
