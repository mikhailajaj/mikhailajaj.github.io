Sheridan College  Official Document Cover Page 
 
Sheridan College official documents are issued directly through MyCreds™ which is owned by the Association of 
Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC) and powered by Digitary, a trusted international 
verified digital credential platform. MyCreds™ ensures document authenticity. When transcripts, credentials, and any 
other documents are issued through MyCreds™, they are verifiable, secure, and include a cryptographic signature. 
 
If you have received a notification of this document from noreply@mycreds.ca  and a link to access it through 
MyCreds™, you are viewing a certified official document that you can trust. A document routed to you as an 
attachment from an individual personal email is not official and may not reflect the most recent version.  
 
When viewed in PDF format in Adobe 9.0 or later, this document has a number of security features described below. 
These security features do not apply to a printed copy. Under no circumstance should a printed copy be relied upon as 
it could be subject to tampering. This document is shared as a single-use transaction between the learner and the 
recipient and downloads are for record keeping purposes only. Forwarding or reproducing this document will render 
the document not valid. 
Security information 
To verify the authenticity of the digital document, make sure you are accessing it online via a link to the document on 
MyCreds™. The link will start with https://learner.mycreds.ca . 
When viewed in PDF format in Adobe 9.0 (or later), the digital signature of the document should be interpreted as 
follows:  
 
The blue-ribbon symbol signifies that the contents of the document have not been altered after it was 
downloaded.  It does not signify its currency (it may have been revoked or replaced by the institution or 
organization with a more up to date document). If the document does not display a valid certification and 
signature message, reject this document immediately. 
 
This symbol with a red cross signifies that the issued document is invalid. An invalid digital certificate display 
means either the digital signature is not authentic, or the document has been altered. A document with an 
invalid digital signature display should be rejected. 
 
This symbol signifies that the Author is Unknown. Author Unknown can have two possible meanings: The 
document is a self-signed document or has been issued by an unknown or untrusted authority and therefore 
has not been trusted. If you receive this message, make sure you are properly connected to the internet. If 
you have a connection and you still cannot validate the digital signature on-line, reject this document. 
 
This symbol indicates that Adobe needs to validate the signatures. You will need to follow the instructions to 
validate the signature. Should the signature validate successfully, you will be presented with the blue-ribbon 
symbol above. If it cannot validate the signature, the red cross will be presented. 
 
This document is available for viewing until the expiry date set by the Learner.  If your access has expired, you will 
need to contact the Learner to request a new share of the document. MyCreds™ cannot reissue documents.  
For details about Sheridan College grading scales, academic standing and continuance policies, please refer to the 
institutional legend.
