# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application has significant UI/UX issues affecting user experience across multiple pages and components. The Experience, Education, and Achievements pages have poor theme adaptation, and the light theme suffers from contrast problems with gray text that impacts readability and accessibility. These issues need to be systematically addressed to ensure consistent, accessible, and visually appealing user experience across all themes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the portfolio in light theme, I want proper text contrast so that I can easily read all content without straining my eyes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing pages in light theme THEN all text SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN gray text is used THEN it SHALL have sufficient contrast against the background in both light and dark themes
3. WHEN switching between themes THEN text readability SHALL be maintained consistently
4. WHEN using accessibility tools THEN contrast ratios SHALL pass automated testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating between Experience, Education, and Achievements pages, I want consistent theme adaptation so that the visual experience is cohesive across all sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Experience, Education, or Achievements pages THEN they SHALL properly adapt to the current theme (light/dark)
2. WHEN switching themes THEN all components on these pages SHALL update their appearance accordingly
3. WHEN comparing pages THEN the visual styling SHALL be consistent with the rest of the application
4. WHEN using theme-aware components THEN they SHALL respond to theme changes without page refresh

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all components to support proper theme adaptation so that I can use high contrast modes and custom themes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN all components SHALL maintain readability and functionality
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL use semantic color tokens instead of hardcoded colors
3. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN theme changes SHALL not break component functionality
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN theme-related information SHALL not interfere with content accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want consistent theme implementation patterns so that future components automatically inherit proper theme support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new components THEN they SHALL follow established theme patterns and use design tokens
2. WHEN updating existing components THEN theme implementation SHALL be consistent across the codebase
3. WHEN theme tokens are changed THEN all components SHALL automatically reflect the updates
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN theme implementation SHALL be easily maintainable and scalable

## Identified Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Hard-coded Background Colors**: Pages use `bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-black` which doesn't adapt to light theme
2. **Poor Light Theme Contrast**: Gray text (`text-gray-300`, `text-gray-400`, `text-gray-500`) has insufficient contrast in light theme
3. **Missing Theme Adaptation**: Components don't respond to theme changes
4. **Inconsistent Color Usage**: Mix of hardcoded colors and theme tokens

### Affected Components
- Experience, Education, Achievements page layouts
- ExperienceTimeline, EducationTimeline, AchievementGallery components
- Various other components using hardcoded gray colors (1598+ instances found)

### Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Poor readability in light theme
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance failures
- **Brand Consistency**: Inconsistent visual experience
- **Maintenance**: Difficult to update theme colors globally
