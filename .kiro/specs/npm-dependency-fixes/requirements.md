# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project is experiencing npm install failures due to dependency conflicts, primarily involving React version mismatches and unnecessary React Native dependencies being pulled in by Three.js packages. This feature will systematically resolve all dependency conflicts, optimize the package configuration, and ensure a clean, reliable build process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want npm install to complete successfully without errors, so that I can develop and build the project reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm install` THEN the system SHALL complete without ERESOLVE errors
2. WHEN running `npm install` THEN the system SHALL not pull in React Native dependencies for a web-only project
3. WHEN running `npm install` THEN all peer dependency conflicts SHALL be resolved
4. WHEN running `npm install` THEN the installation SHALL complete in under 2 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent React and TypeScript versions across all dependencies, so that there are no type conflicts or runtime issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN all React-related packages SHALL use compatible versions
2. WHEN running TypeScript compilation THEN there SHALL be no version-related type errors
3. WHEN using React 18.3.1 THEN all peer dependencies SHALL be satisfied
4. IF React types are overridden THEN they SHALL be consistent across all packages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Three.js and related 3D packages to work without pulling in mobile dependencies, so that the bundle size remains optimized for web.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing @react-three/fiber THEN it SHALL not require React Native
2. WHEN installing @react-three/drei THEN it SHALL work with web-only React setup
3. WHEN building the project THEN no React Native code SHALL be included in the bundle
4. WHEN using Three.js components THEN they SHALL render correctly in the browser

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all build and development scripts to work correctly after dependency fixes, so that the development workflow is uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run dev` THEN the development server SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the production build SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN running `npm run test` THEN all tests SHALL execute without dependency-related failures
4. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN linting SHALL complete without package-related errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want package.json to be optimized and clean, so that future dependency management is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN there SHALL be no unused dependencies
2. WHEN examining package.json THEN version ranges SHALL be appropriate and not overly restrictive
3. WHEN examining package.json THEN overrides SHALL only be used when necessary
4. WHEN adding new dependencies THEN they SHALL not conflict with existing ones

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of dependency choices, so that future maintainers understand the reasoning behind specific versions and overrides.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be documentation explaining React type overrides
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be documentation explaining any package.json overrides
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be guidance for adding new dependencies safely
4. WHEN encountering dependency conflicts THEN there SHALL be troubleshooting documentation
