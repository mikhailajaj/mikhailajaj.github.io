## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to the clean, organized project management system implementing principles from "The Clean Code Cookbook" by Nigel Dsouza.

## 📚 Current Active Projects

### 🚀 EPIC 1.0: Clean Code Architecture & Project Management

**Status**: In Progress | **Priority**: High | **Owner**: Development Team

#### Active Stories

- **[STORY 1.1: Directory Cleanup & Naming](./STORY_1.1_DIRECTORY_CLEANUP.md)** - 🚀 In Progress
  - Clean up duplicate directory structures
  - Implement consistent naming conventions
  - Consolidate data management architecture

#### Upcoming Stories

- **STORY 1.2**: Implement Clean Function Patterns - 📋 Planned
- **STORY 1.3**: Establish Logging & Error Handling Standards - 📋 Planned
- **STORY 1.4**: Create Project Management Documentation - 📋 Planned
- **STORY 1.5**: Archive Completed Documentation - 📋 Planned

## 🎨 Clean Code Principles Applied

### 1. **Name Things Like They Matter**

```
✅ EPIC_1.0_CLEAN_CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md
✅ STORY_1.1_DIRECTORY_CLEANUP.md
❌ epic1.md, story-1-1.md
```

### 2. **Keep Documents Focused**

- Each document has single responsibility
- Clear separation between epics, stories, and tasks
- Focused scope and objectives

### 3. **Don't Repeat Information**

- Reference rather than duplicate content
- Maintain single source of truth
- Link related documents effectively

### 4. **Format Like You Mean It**

- Consistent markdown formatting
- Clear visual hierarchy with emojis
- Professional, readable presentation

### 5. **Make Dependencies Obvious**

- Explicit story relationships
- Clear prerequisite identification
- Transparent impact analysis
