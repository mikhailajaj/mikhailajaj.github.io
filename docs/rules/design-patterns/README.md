## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

| Pattern | Description | Detailed Documentation |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Factory Method | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate | [Factory Method](./creational/factory-method.md) |
| Abstract Factory | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects | [Abstract Factory](./creational/abstract-factory.md) |
| Builder | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation | [Builder](./creational/builder.md) |
| Singleton | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it | [Singleton](./creational/singleton.md) |
| Prototype | Creates new objects by copying an existing object | [Prototype](./creational/prototype.md) |

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

| Pattern | Description | Detailed Documentation |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Adapter | Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect | [Adapter](./structural/adapter.md) |
| Bridge | Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently | [Bridge](./structural/bridge.md) |
| Composite | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies | [Composite](./structural/composite.md) |
| Decorator | Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically | [Decorator](./structural/decorator.md) |
| Facade | Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem | [Facade](./structural/facade.md) |
| Flyweight | Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently | [Flyweight](./structural/flyweight.md) |
| Proxy | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it | [Proxy](./structural/proxy.md) |

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

| Pattern | Description | Detailed Documentation |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Chain of Responsibility | Passes a request along a chain of handlers | [Chain of Responsibility](./behavioral/chain-of-responsibility.md) |
| Command | Encapsulates a request as an object | [Command](./behavioral/command.md) |
| Interpreter | Implements a specialized language | [Interpreter](./behavioral/interpreter.md) |
| Iterator | Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially | [Iterator](./behavioral/iterator.md) |
| Mediator | Defines simplified communication between classes | [Mediator](./behavioral/mediator.md) |
| Memento | Captures and externalizes an object's internal state | [Memento](./behavioral/memento.md) |
| Observer | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects | [Observer](./behavioral/observer.md) |
| State | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes | [State](./behavioral/state.md) |
| Strategy | Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable | [Strategy](./behavioral/strategy.md) |
| Template Method | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses | [Template Method](./behavioral/template-method.md) |
| Visitor | Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure | [Visitor](./behavioral/visitor.md) |

## Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns address various aspects of the software architecture.

| Pattern | Description | Detailed Documentation |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Repository | Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers | [Repository](./architectural/repository.md) |
| Service | Provides operations that aren't a natural part of a domain object | [Service](./architectural/service.md) |
| Unit of Work | Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction | [Unit of Work](./architectural/unit-of-work.md) |
| Dependency Injection | Passes the dependencies of an object to its constructor or methods | [Dependency Injection](./architectural/dependency-injection.md) |
| CQRS | Separates read and update operations for a data store | [CQRS](./architectural/cqrs.md) |
| Event Sourcing | Captures all changes to an application state as a sequence of events | [Event Sourcing](./architectural/event-sourcing.md) |

## React Patterns

Patterns specific to React development.

| Pattern | Description | Detailed Documentation |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Compound Components | Components that work together to form a complete UI | [Compound Components](./react/compound-components.md) |
| Render Props | A technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function | [Render Props](./react/render-props.md) |
| Higher-Order Components | A function that takes a component and returns a new component | [Higher-Order Components](./react/higher-order-components.md) |
| Custom Hooks | Reusable stateful logic that can be shared between components | [Custom Hooks](./react/custom-hooks.md) |
| Context | Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without passing props down manually | [Context](./react/context.md) |
| State Machines | Manages component state transitions | [State Machines](./react/state-machines.md) |

## When to Use Each Pattern

Choosing the right pattern for a specific situation is crucial. Here's a guide to help you decide:

### Use Creational Patterns When:

- You need to create objects without specifying the exact class
- You want to hide the creation logic from the client
- You need to create objects with different configurations
- You need to ensure only one instance of a class exists

### Use Structural Patterns When:

- You need to make incompatible interfaces work together
- You want to compose objects into tree structures
- You need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- You want to simplify complex subsystems

### Use Behavioral Patterns When:

- You need to define communication between objects
- You want to encapsulate algorithms and behaviors
- You need to implement event handling systems
- You want to implement state-dependent behaviors

### Use Architectural Patterns When:

- You're designing the overall structure of an application
- You need to separate concerns in your application
- You want to improve maintainability and testability
- You need to handle complex data flows

### Use React Patterns When:

- You need to share logic between components
- You want to create flexible and reusable components
- You need to manage complex state logic
- You want to improve component composition

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing design patterns in the Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project, follow these guidelines:

1. **Simplicity First**: Choose the simplest pattern that solves the problem
2. **Consistency**: Use patterns consistently throughout the codebase
3. **Documentation**: Document why a pattern was chosen for a specific implementation
4. **Testing**: Ensure pattern implementations are well-tested
5. **Refactoring**: Be willing to refactor to a different pattern if requirements change

For detailed implementation guidelines, see the [Implementation Best Practices](./implementation-best-practices.md).
