# Accessibility Guidelines

This section provides guidelines and best practices for ensuring the **Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio** is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Accessibility is not only a legal requirement but also demonstrates professional commitment to inclusive design and technical excellence.

## Core Principles

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable. Users must be able to interact with the interface.
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
