# Next.js Theme & Context System Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing and enhancing the Next.js theme and context system in the Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio application. The current system includes domain-aware theming, multiple context providers, and various hooks, but requires optimization for better performance, developer experience, and maintainability.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Next.js App Router** with comprehensive routing structure
- **Domain-aware theming** with 5 domains (full-stack, cloud, data, ux-ui, consulting)
- **Multiple context providers** (DomainTheme, Project, Testimonial, Production)
- **Theme system** with light/dark mode support via next-themes
- **Custom hooks** for user preferences, progressive loading, and scroll animations
- **Comprehensive component structure** with UI, features, and domain-specific components

### Current Challenges
1. **Performance**: Multiple context providers causing unnecessary re-renders
2. **Complexity**: Overlapping theme systems (next-themes + domain themes + custom theme)
3. **Developer Experience**: Complex provider hierarchy and context usage patterns
4. **Maintainability**: Scattered theme logic across multiple files
5. **Type Safety**: Inconsistent TypeScript patterns across contexts
6. **Bundle Size**: Potential optimization opportunities in context providers

## Requirements

3. WHEN changing domains THEN the theme system SHALL maintain the current light/dark preference
4. WHEN accessing theme values THEN developers SHALL use consistent APIs across all components
5. IF theme conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL have clear precedence rules
6. WHEN themes are applied THEN CSS custom properties SHALL be updated consistently

### Requirement 2: Optimized Context Provider Architecture

**User Story:** As a user of the portfolio application, I want fast page loads and smooth interactions, so that the browsing experience is optimal regardless of the complexity of the underlying context system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using contexts THEN developers SHALL have TypeScript autocompletion for all values
2. WHEN creating new components THEN theme and context usage SHALL follow consistent patterns
3. WHEN debugging context issues THEN developers SHALL have access to debugging tools
4. WHEN extending themes THEN the process SHALL be documented and straightforward
5. IF context misuse occurs THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
6. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN context usage SHALL be self-documenting

### Requirement 4: Advanced Hook System

**User Story:** As a developer building interactive features, I want powerful and reusable hooks that integrate seamlessly with the theme and context systems, so that I can create rich user experiences efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using theme hooks THEN they SHALL provide reactive theme values
2. WHEN creating custom hooks THEN they SHALL integrate with existing context patterns
3. WHEN hooks are used THEN they SHALL handle loading and error states appropriately
4. WHEN performance is critical THEN hooks SHALL provide memoization options
5. IF hook dependencies change THEN updates SHALL be batched for optimal performance
6. WHEN hooks are composed THEN they SHALL maintain type safety

### Requirement 5: Responsive Theme Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user accessing the portfolio from different devices and environments, I want themes to adapt intelligently to my device capabilities and preferences, so that the experience is optimal regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from mobile devices THEN themes SHALL adapt to touch interfaces
2. WHEN system preferences change THEN themes SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN theme loading SHALL be optimized
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN themes SHALL provide enhanced accessibility
5. IF reduced motion is preferred THEN theme transitions SHALL be minimized
6. WHEN printing pages THEN themes SHALL provide print-optimized styles

### Requirement 6: Context State Management

**User Story:** As a developer managing application state, I want predictable and efficient context state management that scales with application complexity, so that state updates are reliable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state updates occur THEN they SHALL be batched for optimal performance
2. WHEN contexts are nested THEN state flow SHALL be predictable and debuggable
3. WHEN state persists THEN it SHALL handle hydration correctly
4. WHEN state is shared THEN it SHALL prevent unnecessary duplications
5. IF state corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms
6. WHEN state is complex THEN it SHALL be normalized for efficient updates

### Requirement 7: Theme Customization System

**User Story:** As a designer or developer customizing the portfolio appearance, I want flexible theme customization capabilities that don't break the existing system, so that I can create unique visual experiences while maintaining functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizing themes THEN changes SHALL not break existing components
2. WHEN adding new theme variants THEN they SHALL integrate with the domain system
3. WHEN overriding theme values THEN the cascade SHALL be predictable
4. WHEN creating theme extensions THEN they SHALL be type-safe
5. IF theme customizations conflict THEN the system SHALL provide resolution strategies
6. WHEN themes are customized THEN performance SHALL remain optimal

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the portfolio, I want visibility into theme and context performance so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contexts render THEN performance metrics SHALL be collected
2. WHEN theme changes occur THEN the impact SHALL be measurable
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN developers SHALL receive actionable insights
4. WHEN optimizing contexts THEN before/after metrics SHALL be available
