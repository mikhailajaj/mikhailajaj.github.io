# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses build failures when deploying the Next.js portfolio project to GitHub Pages. The current setup has several configuration issues that prevent successful static export and deployment, including TypeScript errors, ESLint issues, missing environment variables, and potential dependency conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to build successfully for GitHub Pages deployment, so that I can publish my portfolio website without build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the build SHALL complete without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN the build process executes THEN it SHALL generate a static export in the `out` directory
3. WHEN the build completes THEN all required assets SHALL be properly optimized for static hosting
4. IF there are TypeScript errors THEN they SHALL be resolved or properly configured to be ignored during build

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable handling for GitHub Pages, so that the application works correctly in the production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds for production THEN it SHALL use appropriate fallback values for missing environment variables
2. WHEN deployed to GitHub Pages THEN the site URL SHALL be correctly configured
3. IF environment variables are missing THEN the build SHALL NOT fail due to undefined variables
4. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL gracefully handle missing API endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized GitHub Actions workflow, so that deployments are fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN it SHALL use the latest stable Node.js version
2. WHEN building the project THEN it SHALL properly cache dependencies and build artifacts
3. WHEN the build completes THEN it SHALL upload the correct static files to GitHub Pages
4. IF the build fails THEN the workflow SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper handling of disabled API routes and dependencies, so that the static export doesn't include server-side functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for static export THEN server-side API routes SHALL be excluded from the build
2. WHEN the build processes dependencies THEN React Native dependencies SHALL be properly excluded
3. IF there are conflicting dependencies THEN they SHALL be resolved through proper overrides
4. WHEN the static export is generated THEN it SHALL only include client-side assets
