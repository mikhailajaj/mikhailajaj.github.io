# 0003-domain-driven-architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The portfolio needs to showcase expertise across five distinct technical domains:
1. Full-Stack Development
2. Cloud Engineering  
3. Data Analytics
4. UX/UI Design
5. Technical Consulting

Each domain has unique requirements, components, and presentation needs. We need an architecture that allows for domain-specific customization while maintaining code reusability and consistency across the application.

Alternative approaches considered:
- Monolithic component structure with conditional rendering
- Separate applications for each domain
- Plugin-based architecture
- Feature-based organization without domain separation

**Decision:**
We will implement a domain-driven architecture with the following structure:
- Domain-specific pages under `/[domain]/` routes
- Domain-specific components in `components/domain-specific/`
- Shared components in `components/ui/` and `components/features/`
- Domain-aware theming and navigation systems
- Centralized data management with domain-specific schemas

**Consequences:**
- Clear separation of concerns between different expertise areas
- Easy to add new domains or modify existing ones
- Domain-specific customization without affecting other areas
- Consistent user experience across domains through shared components
- Potential code duplication between domains (mitigated by shared component library)
- Increased complexity in navigation and routing logic
- Need for domain-aware systems (theming, analytics, etc.)
- Better scalability for future domain additions
