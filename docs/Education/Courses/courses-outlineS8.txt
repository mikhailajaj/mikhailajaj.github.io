Detailed Description

Students learn to capture business intelligence by designing and managing data warehouse and online analytical processing infrastructures using multidimensional database architectures. Students program higher-level functions of a database such as distributed transactions, advanced SQL operations, NoSQL operations and runtime integration working with standard relational data as well as alternative data models like hierarchical data, file streams and geospatial types. Through specialized data models and statistical algorithms students find correlations and trends in large data sets using data mining. Throughout the course, students focus on the security of information systems. Learning is supported by project-based learning, interactive lectures and labs, and hands-on application of database and data warehouse design and management tools including cloud-based tools.
