# 0002-choose-nextjs-framework

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
We need to choose a web framework for building a professional portfolio website that showcases multi-domain technical expertise. The requirements include:
- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization
- Static site generation capabilities for performance
- Modern React features and ecosystem
- TypeScript support
- Good developer experience
- Deployment flexibility (static hosting, serverless, etc.)

Alternative frameworks considered:
- Gatsby (React-based static site generator)
- Nuxt.js (Vue.js framework)
- SvelteKit (Svelte framework)
- Create React App (client-side only)
- Astro (multi-framework static site generator)

**Decision:**
We will use Next.js 15 with the App Router as our web framework. This decision is based on:
- Excellent React ecosystem integration
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Flexible rendering options (SSG, SSR, ISR)
- Strong performance optimizations out of the box
- Large community and extensive documentation
- Seamless deployment options with Vercel and other platforms
- App Router provides modern React features (Server Components, Streaming)

**Consequences:**
- Strong SEO capabilities through server-side rendering
- Excellent performance through static generation and optimization
- Access to the full React ecosystem and community
- Good developer experience with hot reloading and TypeScript
- Vendor lock-in considerations with Vercel (mitigated by deployment flexibility)
- Learning curve for App Router patterns (offset by better long-term maintainability)
- Bundle size considerations (managed through code splitting and optimization)
