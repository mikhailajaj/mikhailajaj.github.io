# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities privately.

- Preferred: Open a private issue in the repository (if available) or contact the maintainer directly.
- Do not disclose publicly until a fix is released.

## Best Practices in Codebase

- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure headers (see public/_headers)
- Dependency checks (npm audit)
- Avoid leaking sensitive environment variables
