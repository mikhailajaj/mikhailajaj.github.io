Detailed Description

Students explore the design aspects of building complex software systems with a focus on designing applications that are both extensible and maintainable, applying industry proven methodologies, software architectures and modeling software systems using visual modeling languages and tools. Students discover and implement proven solutions to real-world problems using design patterns and anti-patterns and gain the ability of placing programming in the larger context of software development for medium to large-scale software intensive systems. Students participate in interactive lectures, demonstrations, hands-on labs, collaborative case-studies and presentations leading to a higher-level of understanding of the software design process.

Program Context

 	
Hon Bach CompSci - Mobile Comp	Program Coordinator(s): Magdin Stoica
This is the first of 3 required courses that focus on software engineering, analyzing, designing, developing and verifying medium to large-scale software systems using systematic software engineering activities, processes and artefacts. The course focuses on the design of software intensive systems using industry proven design patterns and software architectures as well as the refactoring of legacy software systems using software anti-patterns. Prior development experience of medium scale web-based application is beneficial to understanding the issues pertaining to larger scale software systems. In subsequent courses students gain a higher-level perspective of the software engineering process in its entirety and delve in depth into the software systems verification.

Hons Bach of Computer Science	Program Coordinator(s): El Sayed Mahmoud
This required course is the first of a two-course sequence focusing on using systematic software engineering processes, artifacts, and activities to analyze, design, develop and verify medium- to large-scale software systems. This course uses industry-proven design patterns and software architectures to design software-intensive systems and refactor legacy software using anti-patterns. A further course provides students with a more comprehensive understanding of the software engineering process and the verification of software systems.
