## Core Principles

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class or module should have only one reason to change
   - Keep functions and components focused on a single task
   - Extract separate concerns into different modules

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
   - Use interfaces and abstract classes to allow behavior extension
   - Implement new functionality by adding new code, not changing existing code

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
   - Derived classes should extend, not replace, base class behavior
   - Ensure inherited methods maintain the same behavior as base methods

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Create focused, specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones
   - Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions
   - Use dependency injection to provide implementations to higher-level components

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Avoid code duplication
- Extract common functionality into reusable components
- Use shared utilities and helpers for common operations
- Create abstractions for repeated patterns

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Favor simplicity over complexity
- Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Avoid premature optimization
- Prioritize readability and maintainability

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Only implement features when they are needed, not when you anticipate needing them
- Avoid speculative generality
- Focus on current requirements rather than potential future needs
- Refactor when new requirements emerge rather than over-engineering initially

## Code Quality

### Coding Standards

- Follow the project's style guide and linting rules
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Follow language-specific best practices

### Code Readability

- Write self-documenting code with clear intent
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions and methods short and focused
- Use comments to explain "why" not "what"
- Structure code with logical organization

### Error Handling

- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Use specific error types for different error cases
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Implement proper logging for errors
- Never silently catch errors without handling them

### Defensive Programming

- Validate inputs at system boundaries
- Check preconditions before executing operations
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Design for failure and graceful degradation
- Use assertions to catch programming errors

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture

- Separate concerns into distinct layers
- Maintain clear boundaries between layers
- Ensure dependencies point inward
- Use interfaces to define boundaries
- Keep business logic independent of frameworks and UI

#### Layers

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Contains business entities and logic
   - Has no dependencies on other layers
   - Defines interfaces for repositories and services

2. **Application Layer**
   - Implements use cases and orchestrates domain objects
   - Depends only on the domain layer
   - Contains application-specific business rules

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Implements interfaces defined in domain and application layers
   - Contains database access, external APIs, and framework integration
   - Adapts external concerns to the application's needs

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - Handles UI concerns and user interaction
   - Depends on the application layer
   - Transforms application data for presentation

### Feature-First Organization

- Organize code by feature rather than technical concern
- Keep related code together regardless of type
- Maintain clear boundaries between features
- Define explicit public APIs for features
- Use shared modules for cross-cutting concerns

### Modular Design

- Design for modularity and composability
- Create loosely coupled modules with high cohesion
- Define clear interfaces between modules
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Enable independent development and testing of modules

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

1. **Factory Method**
   - Use factory methods to create objects
   - Hide implementation details of object creation
   - Allow subclasses to alter the type of objects created

   ```typescript
   // Factory method pattern
   interface UserFactory {
     createUser(data: UserData): User;
   }
   
   class AdminUserFactory implements UserFactory {
     createUser(data: UserData): User {
       return new AdminUser(data);
     }
   }
   
   class RegularUserFactory implements UserFactory {
     createUser(data: UserData): User {
       return new RegularUser(data);
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Singleton**
   - Use sparingly and only when truly needed
   - Implement as a module with exported functions rather than a class
   - Ensure thread safety in concurrent environments

   ```typescript
   // Singleton pattern as a module
   // config.ts
   let config: AppConfig | null = null;
   
   export function initConfig(initialConfig: AppConfig): void {
     if (config === null) {
       config = initialConfig;
     }
   }
   
   export function getConfig(): AppConfig {
     if (config === null) {
       throw new Error('Config not initialized');
     }
     return config;
   }
   ```

3. **Builder**
   - Use for objects with many optional parameters
   - Provide a fluent interface for object construction
   - Separate construction from representation

   ```typescript
   // Builder pattern
   class ProjectBuilder {
     private project: Partial<Project> = {};
     
     withTitle(title: string): ProjectBuilder {
       this.project.title = title;
       return this;
     }
     
     withDescription(description: string): ProjectBuilder {
       this.project.description = description;
       return this;
     }
     
     withClient(client: Client): ProjectBuilder {
       this.project.client = client;
       return this;
     }
     
     // Other builder methods...
     
     build(): Project {
       // Validate required fields
       if (!this.project.title || !this.project.client) {
         throw new Error('Project requires title and client');
       }
       
       // Set defaults for optional fields
       const project = {
         ...this.project,
         status: this.project.status || ProjectStatus.Pending,
         createdAt: new Date(),
         updatedAt: new Date(),
       } as Project;
       
       return project;
     }
   }
   ```

### Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter**
   - Use to make incompatible interfaces work together
   - Convert one interface to another
   - Enable integration with external systems

   ```typescript
   // Adapter pattern
   interface PaymentGateway {
     processPayment(amount: number, cardDetails: CardDetails): Promise<PaymentResult>;
   }
   
   // External payment service with incompatible interface
   class StripeService {
     async charge(paymentInfo: StripePaymentInfo): Promise<StripeResult> {
       // Implementation
       return { success: true, transactionId: '123' };
     }
   }
   
   // Adapter for Stripe
   class StripeAdapter implements PaymentGateway {
     private stripeService: StripeService;
     
     constructor(stripeService: StripeService) {
       this.stripeService = stripeService;
     }
     
     async processPayment(amount: number, cardDetails: CardDetails): Promise<PaymentResult> {
       // Convert to Stripe format
       const stripePaymentInfo: StripePaymentInfo = {
         amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
         card: {
           number: cardDetails.cardNumber,
           exp_month: cardDetails.expiryMonth,
           exp_year: cardDetails.expiryYear,
           cvc: cardDetails.cvc,
         },
       };
       
       // Call Stripe service
       const stripeResult = await this.stripeService.charge(stripePaymentInfo);
       
       // Convert result back to our format
       return {
         successful: stripeResult.success,
         transactionId: stripeResult.transactionId,
         timestamp: new Date(),
       };
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Composite**
   - Use for tree-like object structures
   - Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly
   - Enable recursive operations on object hierarchies

   ```typescript
   // Composite pattern
   interface UIComponent {
     render(): string;
   }
   
   class Text implements UIComponent {
     constructor(private content: string) {}
     
     render(): string {
       return this.content;
     }
   }
   
   class Container implements UIComponent {
     private children: UIComponent[] = [];
     
     add(component: UIComponent): void {
       this.children.push(component);
     }
     
     render(): string {
       return `<div>${this.children.map(child => child.render()).join('')}</div>`;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Decorator**
   - Use to add behavior to objects dynamically
   - Provide a flexible alternative to subclassing
   - Implement cross-cutting concerns

   ```typescript
   // Decorator pattern
   interface HttpClient {
     get<T>(url: string): Promise<T>;
     post<T>(url: string, data: unknown): Promise<T>;
   }
   
   class BaseHttpClient implements HttpClient {
     async get<T>(url: string): Promise<T> {
       const response = await fetch(url);
       return response.json();
     }
     
     async post<T>(url: string, data: unknown): Promise<T> {
       const response = await fetch(url, {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
         body: JSON.stringify(data),
       });
       return response.json();
     }
   }
   
   class LoggingHttpClient implements HttpClient {
     constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {}
     
     async get<T>(url: string): Promise<T> {
       console.log(`GET ${url}`);
       const startTime = Date.now();
       try {
         const result = await this.httpClient.get<T>(url);
         console.log(`GET ${url} completed in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
         return result;
       } catch (error) {
         console.error(`GET ${url} failed: ${error}`);
         throw error;
       }
     }
     
     async post<T>(url: string, data: unknown): Promise<T> {
       console.log(`POST ${url}`, data);
       const startTime = Date.now();
       try {
         const result = await this.httpClient.post<T>(url, data);
         console.log(`POST ${url} completed in ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);
         return result;
       } catch (error) {
         console.error(`POST ${url} failed: ${error}`);
         throw error;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Behavioral Patterns

1. **Observer**
   - Use for event handling and notification
   - Implement publish-subscribe relationships
   - Decouple event sources from event handlers

   ```typescript
   // Observer pattern
   interface Observer<T> {
     update(data: T): void;
   }
   
   class Subject<T> {
     private observers: Observer<T>[] = [];
     
     addObserver(observer: Observer<T>): void {
       this.observers.push(observer);
     }
     
     removeObserver(observer: Observer<T>): void {
       const index = this.observers.indexOf(observer);
       if (index !== -1) {
         this.observers.splice(index, 1);
       }
     }
     
     notify(data: T): void {
       this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update(data));
     }
   }
   
   // Example usage
   class ProjectRepository {
     private projectSubject = new Subject<Project>();
     
     addObserver(observer: Observer<Project>): void {
       this.projectSubject.addObserver(observer);
     }
     
     async updateProject(id: string, updates: Partial<Project>): Promise<Project> {
       // Update project in database
       const updatedProject = await this.performUpdate(id, updates);
       
       // Notify observers
       this.projectSubject.notify(updatedProject);
       
       return updatedProject;
     }
     
     private async performUpdate(id: string, updates: Partial<Project>): Promise<Project> {
       // Implementation
       return {} as Project;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Strategy**
   - Use to define a family of interchangeable algorithms
   - Encapsulate each algorithm in a separate class
   - Allow algorithms to be selected at runtime

   ```typescript
   // Strategy pattern
   interface PaymentStrategy {
     pay(amount: number): Promise<PaymentResult>;
   }
   
   class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
     constructor(private cardDetails: CardDetails) {}
     
     async pay(amount: number): Promise<PaymentResult> {
       // Implementation for credit card payment
       return { successful: true, transactionId: '123', timestamp: new Date() };
     }
   }
   
   class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
     constructor(private email: string) {}
     
     async pay(amount: number): Promise<PaymentResult> {
       // Implementation for PayPal payment
       return { successful: true, transactionId: '456', timestamp: new Date() };
     }
   }
   
   class PaymentProcessor {
     constructor(private paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy) {}
     
     setPaymentStrategy(paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy): void {
       this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
     }
     
     async processPayment(amount: number): Promise<PaymentResult> {
       return this.paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Command**
   - Use to encapsulate a request as an object
   - Parameterize objects with operations
   - Support undoable operations and command queuing

   ```typescript
   // Command pattern
   interface Command {
     execute(): Promise<void>;
     undo(): Promise<void>;
   }
   
   class CreateProjectCommand implements Command {
     private createdProject: Project | null = null;
     
     constructor(
       private projectData: CreateProjectData,
       private projectRepository: ProjectRepository
     ) {}
     
     async execute(): Promise<void> {
       this.createdProject = await this.projectRepository.createProject(this.projectData);
     }
     
     async undo(): Promise<void> {
       if (this.createdProject) {
         await this.projectRepository.deleteProject(this.createdProject.id);
         this.createdProject = null;
       }
     }
   }
   
   class UpdateProjectCommand implements Command {
     private previousState: Project | null = null;
     
     constructor(
       private projectId: string,
       private updates: Partial<Project>,
       private projectRepository: ProjectRepository
     ) {}
     
     async execute(): Promise<void> {
       // Save previous state for undo
       this.previousState = await this.projectRepository.getProject(this.projectId);
       
       // Apply updates
       await this.projectRepository.updateProject(this.projectId, this.updates);
     }
     
     async undo(): Promise<void> {
       if (this.previousState) {
         await this.projectRepository.updateProject(
           this.projectId,
           this.previousState
         );
       }
     }
   }
   
   class CommandProcessor {
     private executedCommands: Command[] = [];
     
     async executeCommand(command: Command): Promise<void> {
       await command.execute();
       this.executedCommands.push(command);
     }
     
     async undoLastCommand(): Promise<void> {
       const command = this.executedCommands.pop();
       if (command) {
         await command.undo();
       }
     }
   }
   ```
