# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Clean up package.json and resolve dependency conflicts
  - Remove or override conflicting React Native dependencies
  - Add strategic npm overrides to prevent version conflicts
  - Update Three.js packages to compatible versions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Configure npm overrides and resolutions
  - Add overrides section to package.json to exclude React Native
  - Set React version resolutions to maintain consistency
  - Configure peer dependency overrides for Three.js packages
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Update Next.js configuration for optimal dependency handling
  - Modify next.config.mjs to exclude React Native from webpack bundles
  - Optimize package imports configuration for Three.js packages
  - Configure webpack to properly handle Three.js dependencies
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Implement error boundaries for Three.js components
  - Create ErrorBoundary component specifically for 3D components
  - Wrap ThreeDBlackPearl component with error boundary
  - Add fallback UI for when Three.js fails to load
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Add lazy loading for Three.js components
  - Convert ThreeDBlackPearl to lazy-loaded component
  - Implement loading states and fallback components
  - Add dynamic imports with error handling for 3D components
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Test and validate dependency resolution
  - Create test script to validate clean npm install
  - Verify no React Native dependencies in node_modules
  - Test development server startup after dependency fixes
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 7. Test build process and bundle optimization
  - Verify production build completes without errors
  - Analyze bundle to ensure no React Native code is included
  - Test that Three.js components render correctly in production
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Create dependency management documentation
  - Document the npm overrides and their purposes
  - Create troubleshooting guide for future dependency conflicts
  - Add guidance for safely adding new Three.js related packages
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 9. Validate all development scripts work correctly
  - Test npm run dev starts without dependency errors
  - Test npm run build completes successfully
  - Test npm run test executes without package-related failures
  - Test npm run lint completes without package errors
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 10. Clean up unused dependencies and optimize package.json
  - Remove any unused dependencies from package.json
  - Optimize version ranges for better dependency resolution
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly categorized
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
