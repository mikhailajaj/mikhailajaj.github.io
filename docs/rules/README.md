## ðŸš€ **Quick Start Guide**

### **For New Contributors**
1. Read [PORTFOLIO_RULES_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./PORTFOLIO_RULES_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for comprehensive overview
2. Review [File Structure Guidelines](./file-structure/README.md) for project organization
3. Understand [Component Structure](./components/component-structure.md) for consistent development
4. Check [Import Structure](./file-structure/import-structure.md) for proper dependencies

### **For Active Development**
1. **Before Coding**: Review domain-specific guidelines and performance targets
2. **During Development**: Follow accessibility and performance best practices
3. **Before Committing**: Run quality checks and validate against standards
4. **Code Reviews**: Use these guidelines as evaluation criteria

### **For Quality Assurance**
1. **Accessibility**: Validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
2. **Performance**: Check Core Web Vitals and loading times
3. **Mobile**: Test responsive design and touch interactions
4. **SEO**: Ensure proper meta tags and semantic structure

## Rule Enforcement

Some rules are automatically enforced through:

- ESLint configuration
- TypeScript compiler settings
- Prettier formatting rules
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline checks

However, many guidelines require human judgment and cannot be automatically enforced. Team members are expected to follow these guidelines and help others do the same through code reviews and pair programming.

## Contributing to Rules

These rules are not set in stone. As the project evolves, we may need to update our guidelines. To propose changes:

1. Discuss the proposed change with the team
2. Create a pull request with the updated rule documentation
3. Include examples and rationale for the change
4. Get approval from at least two senior team members

## Rule Precedence

When rules conflict, follow this order of precedence:

1. Project-specific rules in this directory
2. Industry standard best practices
3. Framework recommendations (Next.js, React, etc.)
4. Team consensus during code review

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about how to apply a specific rule or guideline, you can:

1. Ask in the team chat channel
2. Discuss during daily standups
3. Request a pair programming session
4. Add a comment in your code and request specific feedback during review

Remember, the purpose of these rules is to improve quality and consistency, not to restrict creativity or innovation. If a rule seems counterproductive in a specific context, it's worth discussing with the team.
