Detailed Description

Students are immersed into the emerging field of Cognitive Computing and learn to create intelligent applications that use natural language processing, image recognition and other machine learning services. Students integrate various cloud computing AI platforms in the development of mobile application systems. This includes an introduction to working with natural human language and other common cognitive tasks. Students create applications that use new multi-modal input methods by Controlling the flow of communication in a program through enhanced methods of both natural text language and speech recognition and synthesis. Other processes such as computer vision and information generalization add a powerful collection of data processing tools to the student¿s growing repertoire. Students take advantage of cognitive computing services to create modern mobile applications using tools such as voice interaction, translation, computer vision, information generalization, and sentiment/text analytics.
