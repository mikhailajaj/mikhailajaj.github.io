# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application has several pages importing a missing `EnhancedLayout` component from `@/components/layouts/EnhancedLayout`. This is causing build failures and preventing the development server from running properly. Instead of creating a separate layout component, we should leverage Next.js built-in layout features and use Context7 for demonstration and enhanced functionality. The solution should integrate with the existing Context7 demo page for showcasing advanced layout capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the missing layout imports by using Next.js built-in layout system so that the application builds and runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN there SHALL be no "Module not found" errors for layout components
2. WHEN pages need enhanced layout features THEN they SHALL use Next.js layout.tsx files in their route segments
3. WHEN the development server runs THEN all pages SHALL render without layout-related errors
4. WHEN refactoring layouts THEN existing functionality SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want blog and accessibility pages to have proper layout structure using Next.js conventions so that I can navigate the site effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing blog pages THEN they SHALL use Next.js layout hierarchy for consistent structure
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all layout elements SHALL be accessible
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the layout SHALL provide proper semantic structure
4. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN the layout SHALL be responsive using Next.js layout patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to showcase Context7 integration for advanced layout features so that users can see enhanced layout capabilities in action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Context7 demo page THEN it SHALL demonstrate advanced layout patterns
2. WHEN Context7 features are needed THEN they SHALL be integrated through the existing context7-demo page
3. WHEN showcasing layout capabilities THEN Context7 SHALL provide enhanced UI components and interactions
4. WHEN demonstrating features THEN the Context7 integration SHALL show real-world usage examples

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the layout refactoring to maintain consistency with the existing architecture so that it integrates seamlessly with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring layouts THEN the solution SHALL use Next.js App Router layout conventions
2. WHEN implementing layout features THEN they SHALL integrate with existing domain theming
3. WHEN handling accessibility THEN layouts SHALL work with the existing accessibility system
4. WHEN managing errors THEN layouts SHALL use the existing error boundary system
5. WHEN showcasing advanced features THEN Context7 integration SHALL be demonstrated on the context7-demo page
