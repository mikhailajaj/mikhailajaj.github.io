# Font Loading Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Google Fonts loading error that occurs during development and production builds. The current implementation fails to load the Inter font from Google Fonts, causing fallback font usage and console warnings that impact developer experience and potentially user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Font Loading Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to load fonts reliably without network errors, so that the intended typography is consistently displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Inter font SHALL load successfully without 404 errors
2. WHEN Google Fonts is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to system fonts
3. WHEN in development mode THEN font loading SHALL not produce console warnings
4. IF font loading fails THEN the application SHALL continue to function with appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fonts to load quickly and efficiently, so that there are no layout shifts or loading delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN fonts SHALL be preloaded for optimal performance
2. WHEN fonts are loading THEN there SHALL be no visible layout shift (CLS)
3. WHEN fonts fail to load THEN fallback fonts SHALL match the intended design closely
4. IF the user has slow internet THEN font loading SHALL not block page rendering

### Requirement 3: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean console output during development, so that I can focus on actual issues without font loading noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run dev THEN there SHALL be no font-related warnings in the console
2. WHEN building the application THEN font loading SHALL not cause build warnings
3. WHEN fonts are cached THEN subsequent loads SHALL use cached versions
4. IF font configuration changes THEN the system SHALL update gracefully

### Requirement 4: Cross-Environment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user accessing the site from different environments, I want consistent font rendering, so that the visual experience is uniform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from different networks THEN font loading SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN using different browsers THEN font rendering SHALL be consistent
3. WHEN in offline mode THEN cached fonts SHALL be available
4. IF CDN is blocked THEN local font fallbacks SHALL be used

### Requirement 5: Configuration Flexibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible font configuration options, so that I can easily modify or extend font usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font requirements change THEN configuration SHALL be easily updatable
2. WHEN adding new fonts THEN the system SHALL support multiple font families
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN font loading strategy SHALL be configurable
4. IF font sources change THEN the system SHALL support alternative CDNs or local hosting
