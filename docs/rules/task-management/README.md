## Introduction

The Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project uses a comprehensive task management system with two main components:

1. **Scrum-based Process Management**: Documented in the `docs/task-management` directory, covering the overall process, ceremonies, and artifacts.

2. **Structured Task Definitions**: Implemented as JSON files in the `docs/tasks` directory, providing a machine-readable format for task tracking and automation.

## Task Structure

Each task in the Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project should follow a consistent structure:

### Task Components

- **ID**: A unique identifier for the task
- **Title**: A concise description of the task
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of what needs to be done
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete
- **Priority**: The importance of the task (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
- **Estimate**: The estimated effort required to complete the task
- **Status**: The current state of the task (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Assignee**: The person responsible for completing the task
- **Labels**: Categories or tags associated with the task
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed before this task can be started
- **Related Tasks**: Other tasks that are related to this task
- **Created Date**: When the task was created
- **Due Date**: When the task should be completed
- **Completed Date**: When the task was completed

### Task JSON Structure

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-123",
  "title": "Implement User Authentication",
  "description": "Implement user authentication using Auth.js with Cloudflare D1 adapter",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Users can sign up with email and password",
    "Users can sign in with email and password",
    "Users can reset their password",
    "Users are redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role"
  ],
  "priority": "High",
  "estimate": "3 days",
  "status": "To Do",
  "assignee": "John Doe",
  "labels": ["Authentication", "Security", "Backend"],
  "dependencies": ["TASK-120", "TASK-121"],
  "relatedTasks": ["TASK-124", "TASK-125"],
  "completedDate": null
}
```

## Task Workflow

The Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project follows a Scrum-based workflow for task management:

### Task States

1. **Backlog**: Tasks that are not yet ready to be worked on
2. **Ready**: Tasks that are ready to be worked on
3. **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on
4. **Review**: Tasks that are completed and ready for review
5. **Done**: Tasks that are completed and have passed review

### Task Transitions

1. **Backlog → Ready**: Task is refined and meets the Definition of Ready
2. **Ready → In Progress**: Developer starts working on the task
3. **In Progress → Review**: Developer completes the task and submits it for review
4. **Review → Done**: Task passes review and meets the Definition of Done
5. **Review → In Progress**: Task fails review and needs more work

### Definition of Ready

A task is considered ready when:

- It has a clear title and description
- It has well-defined acceptance criteria
- It has been estimated
- It has been prioritized
- All dependencies have been identified
- It is small enough to be completed in a single sprint

### Definition of Done

A task is considered done when:

- All acceptance criteria have been met
- Code has been reviewed and approved
- Tests have been written and pass
- Documentation has been updated
- The feature has been deployed to the staging environment
- The feature has been tested in the staging environment

## Task Templates

The Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project uses task templates to ensure consistency and completeness in task creation. Templates are stored in the `docs/task-management/task-templates.json` file.

### Feature Task Template

```json
{
  "title": "[Feature] {Feature Name}",
  "description": "Implement the {Feature Name} feature",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Feature meets design specifications",
    "Feature is responsive on all supported devices",
    "Feature is accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards",
    "Feature has appropriate error handling",
    "Feature has appropriate loading states"
  ],
  "labels": ["Feature"],
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "title": "Create UI components for {Feature Name}",
      "labels": ["UI", "Frontend"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Implement API endpoints for {Feature Name}",
      "labels": ["API", "Backend"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Implement state management for {Feature Name}",
      "labels": ["State", "Frontend"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Write tests for {Feature Name}",
      "labels": ["Testing"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Document {Feature Name}",
      "labels": ["Documentation"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Bug Task Template

```json
{
  "title": "[Bug] {Bug Description}",
  "description": "Fix the bug where {Bug Description}",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Bug is fixed",
    "Tests are added to prevent regression",
    "Root cause is documented"
  ],
  "labels": ["Bug"],
  "priority": "Medium",
  "estimate": "1 day"
}
```

### Refactoring Task Template

```json
{
  "title": "[Refactor] {Component/Module Name}",
  "description": "Refactor {Component/Module Name} to improve {Goal}",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Code is more maintainable",
    "No regression in functionality",
    "Tests pass",
    "Performance is maintained or improved"
  ],
  "labels": ["Refactoring"],
  "priority": "Low",
  "estimate": "2 days"
}
```

## Task Prioritization

The Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project uses the following prioritization framework:

### Priority Levels

1. **Critical**: Must be fixed immediately, blocking other work
2. **High**: Important for the current sprint, should be completed soon
3. **Medium**: Important but not urgent, can be completed in a future sprint
4. **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred

### Prioritization Factors

- **Business Value**: How much value does this task provide to the business?
- **User Impact**: How many users are affected by this task?
- **Technical Debt**: Does this task address technical debt?
- **Dependencies**: Does this task block other tasks?
- **Effort**: How much effort is required to complete this task?
- **Risk**: What is the risk of not completing this task?

### Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Business Value | User Impact | Technical Debt | Dependencies | Effort | Risk |
|----------|---------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|------|
| Critical | High          | High       | Any           | Blocks many  | Any    | High |
| High     | High          | Medium     | High          | Blocks some  | Low    | Medium |
| Medium   | Medium        | Low        | Medium        | Blocks few   | Medium | Low |
| Low      | Low           | Low        | Low           | Blocks none  | High   | Low |

## Task Estimation

The Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project uses the following estimation framework:

### Estimation Units

- **Story Points**: A relative measure of effort, complexity, and uncertainty
- **Time**: Days or hours required to complete the task

### Estimation Factors

- **Complexity**: How complex is the task?
- **Uncertainty**: How much uncertainty is there in the task?
- **Effort**: How much effort is required to complete the task?
- **Knowledge**: How familiar is the team with the task?

### Estimation Scale

For story points, the Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project uses the Fibonacci sequence:

- **1**: Very simple task, well understood, minimal effort
- **2**: Simple task, well understood, low effort
- **3**: Moderate task, some unknowns, moderate effort
- **5**: Complex task, significant unknowns, significant effort
- **8**: Very complex task, many unknowns, high effort
- **13**: Extremely complex task, mostly unknowns, very high effort

For time estimates, the Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project uses the following scale:

- **1 hour**: Very simple task, well understood, minimal effort
- **2 hours**: Simple task, well understood, low effort
- **4 hours**: Moderate task, some unknowns, moderate effort
- **1 day**: Complex task, significant unknowns, significant effort
- **2 days**: Very complex task, many unknowns, high effort
- **3+ days**: Extremely complex task, mostly unknowns, very high effort (consider breaking down)

## Task Documentation

The Mikhail Ajaj Portfolio project uses the following documentation framework for tasks:

### Task Description

The task description should include:

- **Context**: Why is this task needed?
- **Goal**: What is the desired outcome?
- **Scope**: What is included and excluded from this task?
- **Approach**: How should this task be approached?
- **Resources**: What resources are available for this task?

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria should be:

- **Specific**: Clearly define what is expected
- **Measurable**: Can be objectively evaluated
- **Achievable**: Can be realistically accomplished
- **Relevant**: Directly related to the task
- **Testable**: Can be verified through testing

### Task Updates

When updating a task, include:

- **Progress**: What has been accomplished?
- **Blockers**: What is preventing progress?
- **Next Steps**: What will be done next?
- **Changes**: Any changes to the original task?

### Task Completion

When completing a task, include:

- **Summary**: What was accomplished?
- **Lessons Learned**: What went well and what could be improved?
- **Follow-up**: Any follow-up tasks that should be created?
- **Documentation**: Links to relevant documentation
